"Table B6. Number of Active DO Residents, by Race/Ethnicity (Alone or In Combination) and GME Specialty",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2021-22 Active Residents,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The table below displays the number and percentage of 2021-22 active DO residents by race/ethnicity (alone or in combination) and specialty. ""Alone or in combination"" indicates those who selected a race/ethnicity category alone or in combination with another race/ethnicity response. The sum of the race/ethnicity categories may not add to the total number of residents since a resident could designate multiple race/ethnicity categories. For example, in 2021-22, two active DO residents who identified as American Indian or Alaska Native alone or in combination with any other race/ethnicity response were training in Anesthesiology. Race/ethnicity data are only shown for U.S. citizens or permanent residents. The ""Non-U.S. Citizen or Non-Permanent Resident"" category may include residents with unknown citizenship. Data are for graduates of DO-granting U.S. schools. Counts and percentages shown for specialties do not include counts and percentages for the related subspecialties. Please contact residentreport@aamc.org with any comments or questions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Selected Finding: The distribution of active DO residents by race/ethnicity varies across specialties. Overall, 64.4% of active U.S. citizen DO residents in 2021-22 reported White, 21.5% reported Asian, 5.1% reported Hispanic, 2.8% reported Black or African American, 0.6% reported American Indian or Alaska Native, and 0.2% reported Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Additionally, 8.5% of active DO residents were non-U.S. citizens in 2021-22.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
