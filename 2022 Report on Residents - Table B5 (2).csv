"Table B5. Number of Active MD Residents, by Race/Ethnicity (Alone or In Combination) and GME Specialty",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2021-22 Active Residents,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The table below displays the number and percentage of 2021-22 active MD residents by race/ethnicity (alone or in combination) and specialty. ""Alone or in combination"" indicates those who selected a race/ethnicity category alone or in combination with another race/ethnicity response. The sum of the race/ethnicity categories may not add to the total number of residents since a resident could designate multiple race/ethnicity categories. For example, in 2021-22, there were 39 active MD residents who identified as American Indian or Alaska Native alone or in combination with any other race/ethnicity response who were training in Anesthesiology. Race/ethnicity data are only shown for U.S. citizens or permanent residents. The ""Non-U.S. Citizen or Non-Permanent Resident"" category may include residents with unknown citizenship. Data are for graduates of MD-granting U.S. and Canadian schools and of international medical schools. International medical school graduates include both U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizens who graduated from any medical school outside the United States and Canada. Counts and percentages shown for specialties do not include counts and percentages for the related subspecialties. Please contact residentreport@aamc.org with any comments or questions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Selected Finding: The distribution of active MD residents by race/ethnicity varies across specialties. Overall, 48.8% of active U.S.-citizen MD residents in 2021-22 reported White, 21.6% reported Asian, 8.1% reported Hispanic, 6.1% reported Black or African American, 0.6% reported American Indian or Alaska Native, and 0.2% reported Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Additionally, 18.0% of active MD residents were non-U.S. citizens in 2021-22.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
